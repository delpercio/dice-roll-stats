# Every program really has two problems to solve:
1. Logical (what is the algorithm?)
2. Programming syntax (how do I write the actual code?)
​
​
# How to Break Down a Project
1. Read the requirements document in detail.
   1. Take notes of important points
   2. Write down your questions
2. Answer your questions!
   1. Search engine
   2. Ask a peer, coach, facilitator, or instructor
3. Make a development plan
   1. Describe the entire behavior of the program in 3 (or at most 4) steps. Don't use any JavaScript words!
   2. Break down each item into 3 (or 4) smaller steps by asking the question, "How?"
   3. Repeat until it's obvious how to turn the step into JS code.
4. Write the code

## Rolling Dice Development Plan
1. Find the sum of rolling two dice
   1. Generate two random numbers from 1 to 6
        - ____ (describe how to generate a random number)
   2. Add them together
2. Repeat 1000 times keeping track of each result
   1. Loop 1000 times, rolling the dice each time
        - for loop from 0 to 999
        - Call the function from step 1 to get the sum
   2. Store the counts of each possible result in an array
        - At the start of the program, initialize the count array with zeroes
        - For each roll, increment the appropriate index in the array
          `count[rollOfDice] = count[rollOfDice] + 1;`
3. Display the counts as a bar graph
   1. Have one div on the page for each possible result
       (2 through 12)
       - Use 11 divs, with ids "roll2", "roll3", "roll4"
   2. The width of each div should be the count of that result
       - Loop through each div
       - ___ (how to set the width of a div)
       - ___ (where to find the value to set as the width)
   3. Also display the actual number for each result
       - ___
​
### Questions:
1. How do I generate a random number in JS?
2. "count its frequency"?
3. How do I display a bar graph?
